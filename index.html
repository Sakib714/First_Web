      <artical style="font-size: 25px;">
        Critical thinking is the intellectually disciplined process of actively and 
        skillfully conceptualizing, applying, analyzing, synthesizing, and/or evaluating 
        information gathered from, or generated by, observation, experience, reflection, reasoning, 
        or communication, as a guide to belief and action.

        <p align="left">A statement by Michael Scriven & Richard Paul, presented at the 8th Annual International Conference on Critical Thinking and Education Reform, Summer 1987.</p>
        <br/>
        <p align="left">Critical thinking is the intellectually disciplined process of actively and skillfully 
          conceptualizing, applying, analyzing, synthesizing, and/or evaluating information gathered from, 
          or generated by, observation, experience, reflection, reasoning, or communication, as a guide to 
          belief and action. In its exemplary form, it is based on universal intellectual values that 
          transcend subject matter divisions: clarity, accuracy, precision, consistency, relevance, sound 
          evidence, good reasons, depth, breadth, and fairness.</p>

        <p align="left">It entails the examination of those structures or elements of thought implicit in 
          all reasoning: purpose, problem, or question-at-issue; assumptions; concepts; empirical grounding;
          easoning leading to conclusions; implications and consequences; objections from alternative 
          viewpoints; and frame of reference. Critical thinking ‚Äî in being responsive to variable subject 
          matter, issues, and purposes ‚Äî is incorporated in a family of interwoven modes of thinking, among 
          them: scientific thinking, mathematical thinking, historical thinking, anthropological thinking, 
          economic thinking, moral thinking, and philosophical thinking.</p>

        <p align="left">Critical thinking can be seen as having two components: 1) a set of information and 
          ief generating and processing skills, and 2) the habit, based on intellectual commitment, of using 
          those skills to guide behavior. It is thus to be contrasted with: 1) the mere acquisition and 
          retention of information alone, because it involves a particular way in which information is sought 
          and treated; 2) the mere possession of a set of skills, because it involves the continual use of 
          them; and 3) the mere use of those skills ("as an exercise") without acceptance of their results.</p>


        <p align="left">Critical thinking varies according to the motivation underlying it. When grounded 
          in selfish motives, it is often manifested in the skillful manipulation of ideas in service of 
          one‚Äôs own, or one's groups‚Äô, vested interest. As such it is typically intellectually flawed, 
          however pragmatically successful it might be. When grounded in fairmindedness and intellectual 
          integrity, it is typically of a higher order intellectually, though subject to the charge of 
          "idealism" by those habituated to its selfish use.</p>


        <p align="left">Critical thinking of any kind is never universal in any individual; everyone is 
          subject to episodes of undisciplined or irrational thought. Its quality is therefore typically a 
          matter of degree and dependent on, among other things, the quality and depth of experience in a 
          given domain of thinking or with respect to a particular class of questions. No one is a critical 
          nker through-and-through, but only to such-and-such a degree, with such-and-such insights and blind 
          spots, subject to such-and-such tendencies towards self-delusion. For this reason, the development of 
          citical thinking skills and dispositions is a life-long endeavor.
